# Child-Care-Inspection-in-New-York-City---R-Project

Child Care inspection in New York City is a significant issue highlighted in the past three
years (2018-2020) where in the child care center underwent several rounds of inspection for
its legitimacy. This dataset contains a record of all investigations conducted and any related
violations at active, city-regulated, center-based child care programs and summer camps over
that period of time. These violations are pre-adjudged and such violations are subjected to
penalties (fines) and they are submitted to the New York City Office of Administrative Trials
and Hearing where they are adjudged as either sustained/upheld or excused. The dataset in
addition contains more information on the programs, including license information where
each row is a single violation cited during the inspection. This project aims to learn how the
childcare inspection has helped the centers over the period to curb the violation rate by taking
into consideration the following factors like public health hazard violation, critical violation
etc.
